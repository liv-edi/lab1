## Lab 1

In this lab we installed and set up our computers with software tools need for the class and practiced using the software. The software included VSCode and extensions, Node.js, git, and Postman.

We also practiced using terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts. We also created our first Node.js server-side Javascript file.
