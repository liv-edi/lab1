## Lab 1

[Home](https://liv-edi.github.io/cit281/)

In this lab we installed and set up our computers with software tools need for the class and practiced using the software. The software included VSCode and extensions, Node.js, git, and Postman. We also practiced using terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts. We also created our first Node.js server-side Javascript file.

Technologies used in this lab:
- VSCode
- Node.js
- git

The purpose of this lab was to prepare us for course projects.

From doing this lab I gained some understanding of what we will be using from the rest of the course.

```

function square(num) {
    return num*num;
}
console.log('Square opersations:');
for (let i=2; i<=10; i+=2) {
    console.log(`Square of ${i} is ${square(i)}`);
}
```
